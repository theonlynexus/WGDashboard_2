# WGDashboard-2

This is a fork of Donald Zou's [original implementation](https://github.com/donaldzou/wireguard-dashboard/). I tried submitting a PR, but Donald seems to be busy with life, so I decided to fork his codebase.

Goals of this fork:

1. More structure and cleaner code
2. Multiple implementations with feature parity but different stacks (e.g. Flask/FastAPI, JQuery/Vue, etc.) to serve as educational content
3. Docker, Docker, Docker
4. Self-provisioning capabilities similar to [firezone](https://www.firezone.dev/)

Check the [ToDo](TODO.md)

## ðŸ›  Install

### Locally

1. Download WGDashboard

   ```bash
   git clone -b v3.0.6 https://github.com/donaldzou/WGDashboard.git wgdashboard

2. Open the WGDashboard folder

   ```bash
   cd wgdashboard/src
   ```

3. Install WGDashboard

   ```bash
   sudo chmod u+x wgd.sh
   sudo ./wgd.sh install
   ```

4. Give read and execute permission to root of the WireGuard configuration folder, you can change the path if your configuration files are not stored in `/etc/wireguard`

   ```shell
   sudo chmod -R 755 /etc/wireguard
   ```

5. Run WGDashboard

   ```shell
   ./wgd.sh start
   ```

   **Note**:

   > For [`pivpn`](https://github.com/pivpn/pivpn) user, please use `sudo ./wgd.sh start` to run if your current account does not have the permission to run `wg show` and `wg-quick`.

6. Access dashboard

   Access your server with port `10086` (e.g. <http://your_server_ip:10086>), using username `admin` and password `admin`. See below how to change port and ip that the dashboard is running with.

### Docker
